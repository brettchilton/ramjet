description: Initialize project context by reading documentation
---

Read ONLY these essential docs to understand the project:

1. `docs/README.md` - Full project README with quick start, architecture, and API docs
2. `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - System architecture, tech stack, and core features

Do NOT read the entire docs/ directory - it wastes tokens. The above docs tell you where to find more information when needed:
- `docs/AUTHENTICATION.md` - Auth system details (Kratos + Simple JWT)
- `docs/BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md` - API architecture
- `docs/DATABASE_SETUP.md` - Schema and migrations
- `docs/FRONTEND_SETUP.md` - UI development guide
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Development workflow
- `docs/FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md` - Order automation feature details
- `docs/KRATOS_SETUP.md` - Identity configuration
- `docs/feature_plans/` - Implementation plans for features (order_automation, stock_tracking, demonstrator)
- `docs/handover_docs/` - Bug fixes and handover notes

After reading the 2 essential docs, respond with a brief summary of:
- What Ramjet does (1 sentence)
- Key integrations (list)
- Where to find more docs if needed

Then say "Ready" and wait for instructions.
